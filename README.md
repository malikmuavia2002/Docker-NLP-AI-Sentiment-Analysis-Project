# Docker-NLP-AI-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This project demonstrates a sentiment analysis API using Flask and ONNX Runtime. The API classifies input text as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE with a confidence score. The main goal is to provide a lightweight, fast, and deployable NLP model for text sentiment prediction that can run efficiently in a Docker container.
